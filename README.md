# Idempotency and Retry Logic in Reactive Spring Boot

This is part of a structured learning series focused on building robust, production-ready APIs. In this day, we tackle the challenges of **duplicate request handling** using `Idempotency-Key` support in a wallet top-up use case.

---

## üìå Problem We're Solving

When building APIs ‚Äî especially for money movement ‚Äî retries can cause **serious issues**:

- A mobile app user taps ‚ÄúTop Up‚Äù and their request times out...
- The app retries ‚Äî **was it already processed?**
- If not handled, the user may be **charged twice** for the same request.

We solve this using the concept of an **idempotent API**:
> A request with the same `Idempotency-Key` should always return the same result.

## ‚úÖ What This Project Includes

- A `POST /api/wallet/topup` API (Reactive / WebFlux)
- Accepts a custom `Idempotency-Key` header
- Caches responses per key in memory
- Returns same response for duplicate keys
- Demonstrates client responsibilities and best practices
